# Solar-Forecasting-Using-Artifical Neural Networks
We want to predict the power output for a particular array of solar power generators, knowing some environmental conditions.

About DATA

distance-to-solar-noon, in radians.
temperature, daily average temperature, in degrees Celsius.
wind-direction, daily average wind direction, in degrees (0-360).
wind-speed, daily average wind speed, in meters per second.
